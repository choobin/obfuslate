obfuslate, a tiny gzip decoder.

A short almost incomprehensible implementation of inflate capable of decoding gzip files.

Two test scripts are provided. test-obfuslate is used to test a binary against a number of artificial, pseudo-real and real compressed texts from the Repetitive Corpus (see references).

test-btypes explicitly tests decoding of each DEFLATE block type using specially formatted archives.

Implementation notes.

Supports all three DEFLATE block types; no compression, fixed and dynamic Huffman code tables.

Skips ID1 and ID2 check.

Assumes CM == 8 (deflate).

Skips FHCRC, FEXTRA, FNAME and FCOMMENT (if they exist).

Skips the final CRC32 check.

Requires a compiler that supports statement expressions.
