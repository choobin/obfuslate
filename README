obfuslate, a gzip decoder.

A short, almost incomprehensible implementation of inflate capable of decoding gzip files.

Contributions are welcome. Each file should be named N-A.c, where N is the number of characters in the file and A is your Github alias.

A small script is provided to test each binary against a number of artificial, pseudo-real and real compressed texts from the Repetitive Corpus (see references).

A second script is provided to explicitly test decoding of each DEFLATE block type.

Implementation notes.

The larger file supports all three DEFLATE block types; no compression, fixed and dynamic Huffman code tables.

The smaller file supports dynamic Huffman code tables only.

Skips ID1 and ID2 check.

Assumes CM == 8 (deflate).

Skips FHCRC, FEXTRA, FNAME and FCOMMENT (if they exist).

Skips the final CRC32 check.

Requires a compiler that supports statement expressions.
