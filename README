obfuslate, an inflate implementation that decodes GZIP files

The goal of this project (apart from shits and giggles) is to write
the shortest, most incomprehensible code as possible to decode a valid
GZIP file. Contributions are welcome.

Each file should be named N-A.c, where N is the number of characters in
the file and A is your Github alias.

A small script is provided to test each binary against a number of
artificial, pseudo-real and real compressed texts from the Repetitive
Corpus (see references).

Implementation notes.

Supports all three block types; no compression, fixed and dynamic Huffman codes.

Skips ID1 and ID2 check.

Assumes CM == 8 (deflate).

Skips FHCRC, FEXTRA, FNAME and FCOMMENT (if they exist).

Skips the final CRC32 check.
